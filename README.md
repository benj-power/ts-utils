# ts-utils
A library of utilities to be used with TypeScript. I appreciate the established and efficacious utility
libraries out there for both TypeScript and JavaScript. This package will mostly remain unused by the
public/audience - with majority usage coming from my personal projects. I am not writing any
groundbreaking utilities, so it follows that I find the following worthy of explicit mention: I am
writing out of practice, and merriment; working on this project brings me jubilation.
 
**NOTE: I advise against the usage of this library in any serious codebase. Use other established
libraries for your safety and my sanity.**
