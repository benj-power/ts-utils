# bp-ts-utils
A library of utilities to be used with TypeScript. I think it is marvellous there are so many
useful libraries out there for TypeScript and JavaScript. This package is likely to go unused - that
is, by the public/audience - apart from on personal projects and (hopefully) a few projects
at my work. I am not writing any groundbreaking utilities, so it follows that I find the following
worthy of explicit mention: I am writing out of practice, and merriment. it brings me jubilation to
work on this library; whether used by 10000 people or just myself.
