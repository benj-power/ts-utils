# ts-utils
A library of utilities to be used with TypeScript. I appreciate the established and efficacious utility
libraries out there for both TypeScript and JavaScript so, I wanted to make something of a contribution
. This package will mostly remain untouched and unseen by the public/audience - with the majority of usage
 coming
 from my
 personal projects. I am not writing any groundbreaking utilities, so it follows that I find the
 following worthy of explicit mention: I am writing out of practice, and some of the functions are not
 practical and/or logical; I am writing this library out of merriment.
 
**NOTE: I advise against the usage of this library in any serious codebase. Use other established
libraries for your safety and my sanity.**
